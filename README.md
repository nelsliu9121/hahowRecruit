## Comment Annotating

This section addresses the reasoning and utilities I use to do documentation.

1. Following standard `ngDoc` notation.
2. In the beginning of every `.js` files.

## Obstacles

1. Figuring out how to use ngResource, which turned out to be very useful
2. Found out that Angular's Dependency Injection is failing build process without error report.
